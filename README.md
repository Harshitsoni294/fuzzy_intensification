# Fuzzy Intensification

## Overview
This project explores **Fuzzy Intensification** techniques to enhance image contrast using various algorithms. The implementation includes multiple Python scripts, each applying different fuzzy-based and histogram equalization methods.

## Features
- **Multiple Enhancement Techniques**: Implements various fuzzy and histogram-based contrast enhancement methods.
- **Python-Based**: Uses Python for efficient image processing.
- **Comparative Analysis**: Different scripts allow comparison of enhancement results.

## Implemented Algorithms
The following algorithms are implemented in the project:
- **BHE (Bi-Histogram Equalization) Variants**: `bhe.py`, `bhe1.py`, `bhe2.py`
- **BHE with Color Preservation**: `bheclr.py`, `bheclr1.py`, `bhe2clr.py`
- **Fuzzy-Based Enhancement**: `fuzz1.py`, `fuzz2.py`, `fuzz3.py`, `fuzz4.py`

## How to Use
1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/Harshitsoni294/fuzzy-intensification.git
   cd fuzzy-intensification
   ```
2. Run any script:
   ```sh
   python bhe.py
   ```
   (Replace `bhe.py` with the desired script.)

(Ensure OpenCV and NumPy are installed.)
